# MSI-GE70-2OE-Catalina-Hackintosh
Working partially

- 2x USB 3.0 and 2x USB 2.0 ports work. 
- Audio works.
- HD4600 Integrated Graphic works. 
- Atheros Killer 

Doesn't work list
- Wifi card and NVidia GPU, obviously.
- Camera
- Bluetooth 
- if you try, you tell me. 

Problems
- Booting problems. 
- Freezes after wake up. 
- Crazy spinning fans with Catalina and this is the reason why i delete Catalina.

Maybe, i may re-install catalina to my system and try to solve "doesn't work list" in the future
 if catalina won't turn my fans mining-like at that time. 

And Finally, Thanks to Kemal Sanli for his helps and to his repo : https://github.com/kemalsanli/Monster-Abra-A7-V6-Mojave-Clover-EFI
